🌟 Deep Playground Plus : a Project of MLS club SupCom

Deep Playground Plus is an enhanced version of Deep playground, an interactive visualization of neural networks written in TypeScript using d3.js. We've added a new exciting feature that allows users to change the input of the neural network based on their preferences! 🎨🧠

We use GitHub issues to track new requests and bugs. Your feedback is highly appreciated! If you'd like to contribute, be sure to review the contribution guidelines.

Development

To run the visualization locally, follow these steps:

Run npm i to install dependencies.
Run npm run build to compile the app and place it in the dist/ directory.
Run npm run serve to serve from the dist/ directory and open a page on your browser.
For a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing, run npm run serve-watch. This will start an HTTP server and automatically recompile the TypeScript, HTML, and CSS files whenever they change.

For Owners

To push to production, use the command: git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages.
